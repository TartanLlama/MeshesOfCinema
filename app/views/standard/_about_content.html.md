Meshes of Cinema is a film website dedicated to surreal, contemplative, extreme and artistic works from all around the world. You'll find writings ranging from philosophical masterpieces (e.g. Andrei Tarkovsky's *Stalker* (1979)), to artistic B-movies (e.g. Herk Harvey's *Carnival of Souls* (1962)) to post-surrealist craziness a la Alejandro Jodorowsky's *The Holy Mountain* (1973).

The ratings scheme roughly corresponds to these marks /10:

+ Masterpiece: 10
+ Well worth a watch: 8/9
+ Of some interest: 5/6/7
+ Avoid: 1/2/3/4
